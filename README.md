# Knock-Knock

**Knock-Knock** is a self-service web portal for managing IP allow lists via router APIs. It provides a secure and user-friendly interface for users to request temporary access and for administrators to manage access entries.
It is designed to sit behind a Cloudflare Zero-Trust Access application with a policy that allows specified email addresses access. This controls exactly who can use the self-service portal to add their IP to the allow list.
There is currently only support for Unifi routers, but templated for additional models.

## üõ°Ô∏è Cloudflare Access Integration
Knock-Knock is designed to be placed behind a **Cloudflare Access** rule that filters users by email address. This ensures that only authorized users can access the landing page and request IP access.

To configure:
1. Set up a Cloudflare Access policy for your domain.
2. Require authentication via email or identity provider.
3. Ensure the app receives the `Cf-Access-Authenticated-User-Email` header.

### Environment Variables
These variables control how Knock-Knock interacts with your router and secures the app:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `SECRET_KEY` | Used to secure sessions and CSRF protection. Generate a strong random string. |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Password for accessing the admin panel. |
| `ROUTER_TYPE` | Type of router integration (`unifi` or custom). |
| `UNIFI_BASE_URL` | Base URL of your Unifi controller (e.g., `https://192.168.1.1`). |
| `UNIFI_USERNAME` / `UNIFI_PASSWORD` | Credentials for Unifi API access. |
| `UNIFI_SITE` | Site name in Unifi (usually `default`). |
| `UNIFI_GROUP_ID` | Firewall group ID where IPs will be added. |
| `TITLE` | Custom title for the web interface. |
| `EXPIRATION_OPTIONS` | List of options to place in the expiration dropdown menu. Format: #a, where # is a quantity and u is the unit (d = day, w = week, m = month, y = year). 0f = forever. No spaces. Example: 3d,2w,1m,0f |

You can set these in your `docker-compose.yml` or a `.env` file.
